  b. CPU type and model
  c. Information on configured memory, amount of free and used memory

2. WAP to print file details including owner access permissions, file access time, where file name is given as a command line         argument.

3. WAP to copy a source file into the target file and display the target file using system calls.

4. WAP (using fork() and/or exec() commands) where parent and child execute:
  a. same program, same code
  b. same program, different code
  c. different programs

5. WAP to demonstrate producerconsumer problem using shared memory.

6. WAP to demonstrate InterProcess Communication (IPC) between parent and child using
pipe system call.

7. Write programs to understand working of Pthread library.

8. Write programs to implement the following scheduling algorithms
  a. FCFS
  b. Shortest Job First
  c. Shortest Remaining Time First
  d. Nonpreemptive priority based
  e. Preemptive priority based
  f. Round Robin

9. WAP to implement firstfit, bestfit and worstfit allocation strategies.

10. WAP to map logical addresses to physical addresses in a paging scheme. Define the
necessary data structures required for the program. Page size and physical memory size
should be taken as input from the user. Also accept process id and its size from the user and
allocate memory to the process. Make an interactive program to perform the following:
  a. Accept a process id and page no and display frame number for a valid input
  b. Accept a process id to deallocate and display the frame table.
